README.txt
This README file contains some background information and guidance on School District of Philadelphia data. All data is aggregated per school, and is given per school year (e.g. 2011-2012). This set of data was extracted on October 22, 2012 in coordination with State Reporting requirements. Due to other state and federal reporting requirements, much of this data is available from other sources. Typically each entity has their own requirements, and frequently refactor and aggregate data in different ways. Please keep this in mind if you compare this data with data derived from other sources. Most importantly, do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions, or would like to request other data sets.
Happy data diving!
